## Before you promote this site

| Priority | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Blocking | Legal page: fill every `[BRACKET]` (legal name, address, state, payment provider). Have a lawyer review it if you can. | `legal.html` |
| 🟠 Important | `contact@virelloo.shop` doesn't exist yet: set up free email forwarding in Namecheap (*Domain List → Manage → Redirect Email*). | Namecheap |
| 🟠 Important | Contact form: replace `VOTRE_ID_FORMSPREE` with your Formspree id (until then it falls back to `mailto:`). | `contact.html` |
| 🟠 Important | Add a real introduction of the coach (name, background, photo). Never invent credentials. | `about.html` |
| 🟡 Later | Prices ($39 / $109 / $219) and plan contents should match what you actually sell. | `index.html` `#pricing` |
| 🟡 Later | Testimonials: only add real ones, with permission. Fake reviews are illegal (FTC). | — |
